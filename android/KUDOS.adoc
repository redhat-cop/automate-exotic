AnsiDroid, Thank You!
=====================

I probably forgot a few of them, but here are the helpful sources:

- Jonas R. from the company k., with whom I discovered and solved a lot of the caveats, which wouldn't have been possible without his Android knowledge and experience.
- the instructions on how to enable and configure SSHd were adapted from:
* https://alainwolf.ch/en/tech-talk/ssh-cyanogenmod/
* http://www.cromwell-intl.com/technical/samsung-galaxy/ssh.html
* and can also similarly be found at http://lisas.de/~alex/?p=237 (including how to get SSHd to automatically start)
- how to compile Python for Android is based on https://gist.github.com/phillipberndt/ef25e95ef801707eb27a
